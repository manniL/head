- Properly get `key` from HTML element.
- Removed the buggy implementation of removing uncontrolled head elements. For example if you have a `<meta name="description">` in `index.html` (which is not generated by `useHead`) and you use `useHead` to generate the same tag, the pre-existing one will be removed first, but the implementation will incorrectly remove the ones generated by `useHead` itself too, so this feature is now removed.
